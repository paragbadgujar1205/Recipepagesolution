### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I gained a deeper understanding of responsive design principles and the importance of semantic HTML for accessibility. I learned how to effectively use Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox, as well as explore more advanced CSS techniques. I also plan to delve deeper into JavaScript to add more interactivity to my web pages.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an excellent resource for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript documentation. I frequently referred to it while working on this project.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website has a wealth of articles and guides on various CSS techniques, which helped me better understand Flexbox and CSS Grid.
